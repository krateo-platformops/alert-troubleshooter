"""TroubleshootingReport v2 — the structured-investigation contract with the Autopilot agent.

Owns BOTH sides of the contract so they can't drift:
  * STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_INSTRUCTIONS — appended to the RCA prompt; requires the agent to end its
    answer with ONE fenced ```json block matching the v2 status fields.
  * parse_structured_report(text) — defensively extracts + sanitizes that block into the CR's
    status fields. NEVER raises: any malformed/missing JSON degrades to a prose-only (v1) report.

Sanitizing rules (defensive, latest-run-wins):
  * unknown keys are dropped; wrong-typed values are coerced when safe, else dropped;
  * sources[].type outside the enum falls back to "object" (evidence is kept, never lost);
  * reasoningTrace[].evidenceRefs are validated against len(sources): out-of-bounds/non-int
    indices are dropped (the step is kept — a step may legitimately lose a bad citation);
  * steps are renumbered 1..N in the order given (the agent's order is authoritative);
  * rootCause.confidence normalizes number-or-string to a "0.00"-style decimal string in [0,1];
  * remediationPlan[].payload must be a JSON object (the CRD preserves unknown fields there);
    observedOutcome is forced empty — it is filled post-apply by the remediation flow, not here.

Stdlib only (json/re) — unit-testable without the cluster or requests.

  ]
}

Hard rules for this block:
- analyzedResources/sources list ONLY what you actually read this run — never invent entries.
- missingContext and assumptions MUST be honest: if you could not read something you wanted
  (logs, metrics, an object, RBAC-denied, empty results), SAY SO there instead of papering over it.
- EVERY reasoningTrace step MUST cite evidence: evidenceRefs are 0-based indices into "sources",
  and every step needs at least one. A step you cannot back with a listed source belongs in
  "assumptions", not in the trace.
- confidence is 0 to 1. remediationPlan is a PLAN only — it will not be executed automatically;
  order the steps, and make each successCriterion independently checkable. Leave observed
  outcomes out; they are recorded later.
- BE ACTIONABLE: when the evidence identifies a safe corrective write (adjust a limit, fix an
  image tag, patch an Alert query, delete a stuck object), emit AT LEAST ONE step whose verb is
  patch/apply/delete with a concrete payload — not a plan made only of "get" verification steps.
  A remediationPlan that is ENTIRELY "get" steps when a real fix is identifiable is a MISS: an
  operator can't apply a `get`. Only fall back to get-only when you genuinely cannot determine a
  safe write from the evidence (say why in missingContext). Keep every existing safety rail — in
  particular NEVER emit patch/apply/delete for v1/nodes or other cluster-scoped kinds.
- MARK VERIFICATION-ONLY STEPS: a step that merely CHECKS state (verb "get") must say so in its
  description (e.g. prefix "Verify: ...") so it is never mistaken for the corrective action. Put
  the actual corrective write(s) first; list any get-only confirmation steps after them.
- remediationPlan[].description MUST be a SHORT imperative phrase, ≤60 chars, no trailing period
  (e.g. "Restart payments-api deployment", "Provision payments-db database"). Do NOT put constraints,
  namespaces, ports, or labels in description — those belong in successCriterion. Never repeat
  the description text inside successCriterion.
- remediationPlan[].verifyCommand MUST be a single kubectl command (no shell pipes, no &&) that
  lets an operator check the successCriterion (e.g. "kubectl get endpoints payments-db -n payments").
  Omit if no single kubectl command captures the check.
- remediationPlan[].sourceRef MUST be the 0-based index into "sources" of the evidence that best
  explains WHY this step is needed. Required for every step — pick the closest match if none is
  perfect.
- CLUSTER-SCOPED RESOURCES (v1/nodes, v1/namespaces, …): the portal write path requires a
  namespace query parameter that cluster-scoped resources don't have. Use verb "get" ONLY for
  nodes and other cluster-scoped kinds. Never emit verb "patch"/"apply"/"delete" for v1/nodes.
- DEPLOYMENT CONTAINER PATCHES: a merge-patch on spec.template.spec.containers[] MUST include
  both "name" and "image" in the payload's container entry to identify which container to update.
  Omitting "image" causes a 422 Invalid. Fetch the current image with k8s_get_resources first,
  then include it verbatim: {"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"X","image":"<current>","resources":{…}}]}}}}.
- ALERT QUERY FALSE-POSITIVES: when the root cause is a self-referential telemetry feedback loop
  (the alert evaluator/ClickHouse/troubleshooter logs the SQL query into the log store, and those
  log lines match the alert's own where clause), the fix is to patch the Alert CR's spec.where to
  add NOT ServiceName: exclusions for the observability stack. Use gvr
  "observability.krateo.io/v1alpha1/alerts", verb "patch", and payload
  {"spec":{"where":"<original query> AND NOT ServiceName:krateo-observability AND NOT
  ServiceName:krateo-alert-troubleshooter AND NOT ServiceName:krateo-clickstack-clickhouse AND NOT
  ServiceName:krateo-clickstack AND NOT ServiceName:krateo-clickstack-clickhouse-clickhouse AND NOT
  ServiceName:clickhouse-mcp-server"}}. Never target a Deployment or Composition for an alert
  query fix — the alert rule lives in the Alert CR.
- VERIFY WORKLOAD EXISTS before building a remediationPlan step targeting it. If a workload (pod,
  deployment, namespace) is missing or not found when you query k8s_get_resources, do NOT produce
  a remediationPlan step to create or provision it — report it in missingContext instead.
- Output STRICT JSON (double quotes, no comments, no trailing commas)."""
